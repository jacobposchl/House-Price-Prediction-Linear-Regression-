# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression ðŸ“ˆ

This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. The project showcases how linear regression can be used for regression problems in machine learning.

## Features
- Preprocessing of data (handling missing values, scaling).
- Implementation of a linear regression model.
- Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
- Visualization of predictions vs. actual values.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/House-Price-Prediction.git
   cd House-Price-Prediction
